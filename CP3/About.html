    <h1>About Food Truck LBK</h1>
    <p id="about">Food Truck LBK was made to solved a specific problem in the Lubbock area.  Lubbock is relatively new to having food trucks within the city limits.  Food trucks all individually used Facebook pages to coordinate their locations and times of service.  This app provides one location for all vendors to log in and show where they will be selling their delicious food.</p>
